# Neural-Networks

## Analysis 

The goal of this challenge was to create 4 Neural Network models that predict the success of charity investment opportunities with a model accuracy of 75%. The model only achieved an accuracy of 72.58% that told us it has 69 neurons and 2 hidden layers.

The first attempted neural network which has an accuracy of 72.57% told us that there were 88 neurons in 1 hidden layer and used “relu” activation on the hidden layer. I then created a network of 2 layers each with 132 neurons and increased the number of epochs to 100. This slightly increased the accuracy to 72.58% but this seems to be the limit. This resulted in the same accuracy percentage of 72.58%.

Due to the closeness of the model to the potential goal of 75% accuracy the next step would be to optimize this model in order to achieve the desired accuracy.
